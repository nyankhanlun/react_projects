### Next.js with page router

 NextJS does not have an index.html in the public folder due to its built-in server-side pre-rendering.

npm install mongodb

* Use the official MongoDB Node.js driver (mongodb package) to connect and interact with the database securely within API routes.
* Setting fallback to 'blocking' in Next.js allows on-demand page generation without showing empty pages.
* NextJS offers extensive configuration options for data fetching methods like getStaticProps.
* The built-in Next Image component allows for image optimization.
* NextJS supports easy implementation of authentication, including user signup, login, logout, and session management.
* API routes in NextJS enable inclusion of custom server-side REST APIs within React projects.
