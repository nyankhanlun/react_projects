### A (pretty deep dive) Introduction to Next.js

[lecture note]


<b> Advantages of Server Components in NextJS</b><br>
Using React Server Components in NextJS offers several benefits:
* Reduced client-side JavaScript to download, potentially improving website performance.
* Enhanced search engine optimization (SEO) since web crawlers receive fully rendered page content.

 <b>Summary</b> <br>
Understanding the distinction between React Server Components and Client Components is crucial when working with NextJS. Server components improve performance and SEO by rendering on the backend, while client components enable interactive features that require browser APIs. NextJS embraces this architecture to provide a powerful and efficient full stack framework.

* React Server Components execute on the server, improving performance and SEO by sending fully rendered HTML to the client.
* Client Components in NextJS must be explicitly declared with the use client directive and are necessary for features like state, effects, and event handlers.

* Utilized Next.js's usePathname hook to determine the current active path.
* Installed and used the slugify package to create URL-friendly slugs in lowercase.
* Installed and used the xss package to sanitize user-generated content to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

* Dynamic metadata for pages can be generated by exporting an async function named generateMetadata.

<b>[Module Summary] </b> <br>
* NextJS App Router uses the file system with special files like page.js and layout.js to set up routes.
* Server components render on the server by default, with client components opt-in via the use client directive.
* Data fetching can be done directly inside server components without using useEffect or separate backends.
* Server Actions enable async server-side functions to handle form submissions and update the UI, supported by hooks like useFormState and useFormStatus.
* NextJS aggressively caches data; using revalidatePath is essential to fetch and display the latest data after changes.
* Testing in production mode is crucial as behavior can differ from development mode.
* Metadata can be added statically or dynamically to pages for enhanced SEO and page information.
