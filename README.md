### Animating React Apps

* Framer Motion allows animating React components by replacing standard HTML elements with motion components.
* Transitioned from CSS-based animations to Framer Motion for more natural and realistic animations 
* The AnimatePresence component from Framer Motion allows exit animations to play before elements are removed from the DOM.
* Reusing animation states can be efficiently managed by defining constants or using <b> variants</b>.
* Framer Motion's useScroll hook allows tracking of scroll position in pixels and progress.
* The useTransform hook maps scroll values to animation properties like opacity, position, and scale.
* Motion components use a special style prop to smoothly animate changes without re-rendering the component.
* Combining these hooks enables creation of parallax and scroll-based animations with high performance.
