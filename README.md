### Testing React Apps (Unit Tests)

1. npm i
2. npm start

[Note]

* Unit tests focus on the smallest units like functions or components and are the most common.
* Integration tests verify the interaction between multiple components or units.
* End-to-end tests simulate real user workflows but are fewer due to complexity and overlap with manual testing.
* Jest is a popular and easy-to-use tool for running test code and asserting results.
* The global describe function is used to create test suites with a descriptive name.
* Each test suite contains multiple tests grouped logically by feature or component.
* Grouping tests into suites improves clarity and organization as applications grow.	
* Jest is a general JavaScript testing tool used for running tests and asserting results.
