This is practice Project to be ready for hands-on projects.
* Use defaultValue and defaultChecked props to set initial input values based on state.
* Connected form actions to backend submission using React context and hooks.
* The useOptimistic hook in React enables optimistic UI updates by managing temporary state during form submissions.
* Optimistic updates improve user experience by instantly reflecting changes while the actual request is processed, and they automatically rollback if the request fails.
* Form actions automatically collect input values and reset forms, but useActionState can manage returned values to update UI and preserve input.
* Form actions can perform any operation, including storing data locally, using context, or sending asynchronous requests to backends.
* Additional hooks like useFormStatus and useOptimistic support UI updates during asynchronous form submissions.
