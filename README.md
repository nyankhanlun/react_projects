## Building Custom React Hooks

[lecture note]
* React Hooks must be used only inside React Component functions or other Hooks.
* Hooks should not be nested inside conditional statements, loops, or nested functions.
* Custom Hooks enable the reuse of logic that involves Hooks and state management across multiple components.
* Regular functions cannot replace custom Hooks when the logic involves Hooks and state updates, as Hooks can only be used within Components or other Hooks.
* Custom hooks in React must start with use to be recognized and to enforce hook rules.
* Custom hooks enable code reuse and maintainability across different components.
* Using custom hooks to manage state can simplify component logic and enable reusable stateful behavior.
