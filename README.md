### A(prety deep dive) Introduction to Next.js

[lecture note]

* NextJS is a React framework that enables building fullstack applications combining front-end and back-end.
* This section focuses on learning what NextJS is and why to use it.
* You will learn how to set up routes, pages, and work with React components in NextJS.
* The course covers data fetching, styling, image handling, and page metadata in NextJS applications.

In summary, the layout.js and page.js files work together: the layout serves as the wrapper, and the page provides the actual content that will be injected into the layout.
