### Advanced Redux

[lecture note]
* Reducer functions in Redux must be pure, side-effect free, and synchronous.
* Prefer placing synchronous, side-effect-free data transformation logic inside reducers.
* Asynchronous or side-effect code should be handled in action creators or components, never in reducers.
* Practiced using Redux and learned about handling side-effects and asynchronous code.
