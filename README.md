## Replacing Redux with React Hooks
This is practice Project to be ready for hands-on projects.

1) npm install
2) npm start 

[note]
* The React Context API is suitable for low-frequency state updates such as user authentication status or theming.
* It is not optimized for high-frequency updates like toggling favorite status or managing shopping carts.
* Alternative solutions like (https://www.npmjs.com/package/use-global-hook) package leverage React and React Hooks to manage state without heavy dependencies.


<b> Summary </b>
This approach roughly replicates how Redux works behind the scenes but is rebuilt entirely without Redux, saving an extra dependency and using only React and hooks.
